# Project Overview

This project is a full-stack web application built with Rust. It aims to showcase the power and versatility of Rust in web development. The application includes both a backend server and a frontend user interface.

Big thank you to [Francesco Ciulla](https://www.youtube.com/@francescociulla) for the great tutorial.

## Features

- Backend server built with Rust's Rocket framework
- Frontend user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Database integration with PostgreSQL
- RESTful API endpoints for data manipulation
